Today, many aspects of our lives are connected to the internet, including everyday activities such as shopping online, sending emails, or even using social media. In this context, web browsers (browsers) such as Google Chrome have become the primary access window to cyberspace.

Thanks to its intuitive user interface, high browsing speed, and support for various extensions that extend its functionality, Google has become the first choice for millions of users worldwide.

Incognito mode is useful when you want to browse the internet without leaving a digital footprint on your device.

3. Manage Site Permissions Carefully

Google Chrome gives complete control to the user to manage the permissions granted to websites. Be sure to check and manage site permissions wisely.
